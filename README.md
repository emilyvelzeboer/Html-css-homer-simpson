# Homer Simpson's portfolio

After trying out many jobs in his life, Homer Simpson decided to become a developer as he is attending a Keepcoding bootcamp!

In his website, there is a navigation bar, an header with Homer's name and job position, a body, with an introduction of himself and all his skills listed, a form if you want to get to know Homer and finally a footer with his social networks.
